    "description": "This project has been adapted from an earlier version created by Ali Gunnells using AudiAnnotate. The original project is the culmination of an independent study conducted under the supervision of Dr. Tanya Clement during the summer of 2022. This project explores how archival rhetorics are employed in contemporary podcasting through an analysis of Jill Leporeâ€™s podcast The Last Archive. In this project, you will find annotations of the first four episodes of The Last Archive Season 1, which were created using Audacity. ",
